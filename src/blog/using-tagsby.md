I had decided to build my personal portfolio website using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and I'm going to share my experience here.

You can check out the final build on my [GitHub](https://github.com/davidwu220/portfolio).

Everyone has their unique ideas of showcasing their projects and how they like their setup. Mine is to have it **simple**, **easy to maintain**, and **expandable**.

Gatsby popped up when I was first learning about React. After some more digging, I then decided to give it a go because of the [cool features](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/features/) they offers and the ability to expand should I decide to add more features in the future.
